JOINT SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION FOR CORTICAL PARCELLATION

Developed in MATLAB R2014a on Ubuntu 14.04

Prerequisites:
(MUST) Connectome Workbench 
       http://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench.html

Dataset:
This version has been tested on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) datasets. 
The code has a deep dependency with the HCP data structures. However, it can 
also be adapted to any other dataset, by following the steps throughout the
codes. 

If you would like to use the HCP data, it can be downloaded from 
https://db.humanconnectome.org. Make sure that you set the dataset directory
according to your own directory structure.

Tutorial:
Please run the scripts in the following order:
1- Multi_layer_graph_generation
2- Joint_spectral_decomposition
3- Run_clustering_after_decomposition
